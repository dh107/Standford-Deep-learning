      Overll, this app will improve driving safety by identifying irregular driving behaviors and bad road conditions.
      All drivers can benefit from this app. 
      This app will also assist city government effectively locate and repair hazardous potholes.

## Brief Introduction 
Traffic injuries are one of the most severe public health problems in the world (World Health Organization [WHO] 2015). Traffic accident kills around 1.2 million people each year, which has become the seventh leading cause of preventable death in the United States, and the eighth globally (Bureau of Transportation Statistics 2015; WHO 2015). The car crashes not only cause a lot of deaths, injuries and property damages, also produce a significant economic loss (WHO 2015). Driving safety is impacted by various factors, especially road surface conditions and driving behaviors. In this study, we are trying to use mobile devices and GIS methods to 1) detect and measure the size of potholes and 2) identify irregular driving behaviors.
## Objectives and Broad Impacts
The objectives of this project is to develop two mobile apps for:<br />
<br />
**Objective 1: Identify irregular driving behaviors (including speeding, aggressive left/right turn, irregular overtaking, et al.) by mining smartphone sensors’ data.  (Xiao Li)** <br />
Driving behavior, as a crucial contributing factor, closely relates to the road safety. Irregular driving behaviors (such as speeding, drunken driving and irregular overtaking) not only threaten driving safety but also put pedestrians at significant risk, which has become the leading factors for road traffic accident (Lee 2008; Zhao 2011; WHO 2015). There are numerous studies for analysis of driving behaviors (Malik et al. 2008; Johnson et al. 2011; Sun et al. 2014). In this study, the built-in smartphone accelerometer, gyroscope and the magnetometer will be used for data collection so as to obtain the driving information including acceleration, deceleration, speed, and position. The Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) will be adopted to label driving behaviors as “safe” or “unsafe”.

**Objective 2: Detect and estimate the size of driveway potholes.  (Da Huo)** <br />
Road surface roughness, which has been proven the most important criteria for road assessment,is under greater scrutiny. Road surface transient events, such as potholes and bumps, not only impact road quality but also affect driver safety, fuel consumption and road maintenance (Lee 2008; Zhao 2011; Vittorio et al., 2014). Li & Goldberg (2018) has carried out a study which could accurately identify and locate potholes. However, estimation of pothole size was not included in the previous studies, which is more important  for  road maintenance and need to be given more attention.  Consequently, this app will focus on accurate estimation of pothole size (including diameter and depth) which can help city government identify bad road conditions. Based on crowd sensing, our app will assist government effectively locate and repair hazardous potholes.
